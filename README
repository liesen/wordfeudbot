Computer player (or bot) for Wordfeud. Runs on Google AppEngine.

To find out what words to play, the bot asks Wordfeusk (http://www.wordfeusk.se)
for a list of valid words given the current rack and board.

Only Swedish is currently supported, but if you feel like it challenge
"ladyboner" (without quotes). The bot wins about 85% of all games.


RUNNING IT
==========
You need a Wordfeud account in config.py.

Publish the code to an AppEngine app.

To bootstrap: put a task in the update-queue by issuing a POST 
to /update. This is a bit involved: see bootstrap.sh. The bot is 
running as long as there's a task in the update-queue.
